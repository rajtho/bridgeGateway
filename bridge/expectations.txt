The bridge basically acts like a reverse proxy for the client, transferring the payload as-it-is. The bridge though interprets the service/command frame of the client to interpret into the excact connection protocol and the server address. 

So , essentially the client sends <ws><command><payload></ws>

<ws> is the websocket layer framing
<command> : <serviceType:userIdentifier:zeromqCommand>
zeroMqCommand: SUB:*<comma-separated-topics>
serviceType: mkdtData|trd|social|analytics|user
<payload>: the payload that will be directly transfered to the zeromq socket
